    "# Feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "feature engineering is one of the crucial parts of the building a good machine learning model. IF we have useful feature, the model will perform better. We must keep in mind that feature engineering is something that is done in best possible manner only when you have some knowledge about the domain of the problem and depends a lot on the data concern . However , there are some techniques that we can try to create features from almost all kinds of numerical and categorical variables. **feature engineering is not about creating new features from data but also includes different types of normalization and transformations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the most simple but most widely used feature engineering techniques. Let's say you are dealing with **data and time data** . So, we have a pandas dataframe with a datetime type column. Using this column, we can create features like:\n",

    "- And many more\n",
